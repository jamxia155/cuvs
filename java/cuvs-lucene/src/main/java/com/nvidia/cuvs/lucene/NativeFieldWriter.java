 * Native-flat-buffered field writer, used exclusively by {@link
 * NativeFlatBufferedHNSWVectorsWriter}: streams incoming vectors directly into a native host
 * matrix (see {@link CuVSMatrix#hostBuilder}) instead of accumulating a {@code List<float[]>} on
 * the Java heap, so the full dataset is never held twice (heap list + native copy). The matrix is
 * preallocated for exactly {@code numInputVectors} rows, so that count must equal the number of
 * vectors actually added (validated by {@link NativeFlatBufferedHNSWVectorsWriter}).
 *
 * <p>Package-private and float32-only — quantization is not supported on this path. Distinct from
 * the heap-buffered {@link FieldWriter} used by the other accelerated writers; the two share no
 * state or behavior beyond both extending {@link KnnFieldVectorsWriter}.
